# DIRTNet-CornRoot
DIRTNet: A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Non-Destructive Root Phenotyping Using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) Sensor Data.
This repository has code to train and test DIRTNet, a special deep learning model that helps measure root depth and size without digging up the soil. The model uses data from Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors placed in the soil near corn roots. It combines different neural networks (VGG, ResNet, and GRU) to learn both the shape and changes over time in the sensor signals. Inside this repo, you will find:

* Data processing tools to prepare sensor data for the model
* The DIRTNet model code and training scripts
* Custom tools to track training progress and accuracy
* Scripts to evaluate and compare model results

This work helps farmers and researchers monitor root growth easily and supports better crop breeding and farming practices.
